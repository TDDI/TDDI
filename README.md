# TDDI (Test Driven Development Initializer)

TDDI is an educational platform for learning the foundations of test driven development

* **Easily Digestible TDD Basics: ** TDDI presents an easily understood outline of what it means to do TDD 
* **Real-time In-browser Code Evaluation:** Solve testing issues in browser with dynamic feedback
* **Lesson Creation Interface:** Authenticated users can create additional lessons focusing on framework specific testing (Angular, React, Backbone, etc...)
* **Immersive Lesson Narrative:** Curated content that creates mneumonic devices through a unique narrative experience.

## Quick Start

In your repo type:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all dependencies and build a production
version of the app.

```
npm start
```

This command will start a development server and opens a browser window. All files in src folder will be watched for changes and automatically reload either the server or frontend depending on location of the file.
